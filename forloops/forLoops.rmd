# For Loops

### To vectorize or not to vectorize
  

### Basics

The concept of a `for` loop is something pervsaive across many programming languages. Packages and vectorization are generally optimized versions `for` loops that are executed in a more efficient programming language such as C++. However, R still allows utilization of `for` loops. 

When I was first getting started trying to iterate through many tasks, I found `for` loops relatively inutitive compared to some other methods such as vectorization. I believe the greater understandability has to do with the structure. A `for` loop, similar to a function, is a task completed normally but then with one variable that changes, which allows the iterations. Let's take a look at an example of what that might look like getting the correlation between variables among some groups. 

We are going to use the [penguin dataset by Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) as an alternate to the [controversial iris dataset](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/lets-move-on-from-iris/). 

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins <- penguins[!is.na(penguins$body_mass_g),]
penguins <- data.frame(penguins) ## drop NAs and convert to  data.frame
str(penguins)


### separate linear models for each species
adelie <- subset(penguins, species=="Adelie")
corAde <- cor(adelie$bill_length_mm, adelie$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs")
chinstrap <- subset(penguins, species=="Chinstrap")
corchin <- cor(chinstrap$bill_length_mm, chinstrap$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs")
gentoo <- subset(penguins, species=="Gentoo")
corGen <- cor(gentoo$bill_length_mm, gentoo$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs")
penguinDF <- data.frame(species=c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo"), 
                        corValue =c(corAde,corchin,corGen) )

```

The above approach has a few issues with it. Besides being labour intensive, the copy-paste of multiple lines runs of the risk of an error appearing. The person analyzing this data might miss an argument, such as the `use` arguement, or might misspell one of the target species they are analyzing. Without an error message produced by R, there is no way to determine that an error was made along the way. Most importantly, this strategy does not scale easily. For three species, it is annoying, for 1000 species it is impractical. 

We can iterate through these same operations using a `for` loop with less code and less potential of errors. First let's take a look at the basics of what the `for` loop syntax is. At the beginning of the loop you specify the character to iterate through and what values you want them to be assigned. Here list the numbers 1 through 5 by printing the iterating value of i. 

```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
  print(i)
}

```

We can extend this logic to our previous example of subsetting and correlations. Copying down the same syntax from the correlation example, we create a generic dataframe that will be written over each iteration. The important difference here is that as the loop works it will continue to write over objects. We will need to specify a value that comes out so that we get a value for each iteration. 

```{r}

## list species
speciesNames <- c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo")

## Empty vector to fill
outCor <- c()

for(i in 1:3){
tempPenguin <- subset(penguins, species==speciesNames[i]) ## subset species by that iteration
corVal <- cor(tempPenguin$bill_length_mm, tempPenguin$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs") ##conduct correlation
outCor <- c(outCor,corVal) ## join empty vector with new cor value
}
outCor

```

While it is common to use a number to iterate through, you can also use characters or factors like we have in this example. There are some instances where this would be preferable. 

```{r}

## Empty vector to fill
outCor <- c()

for(i in c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo")){
tempPenguin <- subset(penguins, species== i ) ## subset species by that iteration
corVal <- cor(tempPenguin$bill_length_mm, tempPenguin$bill_depth_mm, use="complete.obs") ##conduct correlation
outCor <- c(outCor,corVal) ## join empty vector with new cor value
}
outCor

```

Let's take a look at another example but with linear models where we extract the co-efficients from those models.

```{r}
## Empty data.frame to fill
coefout <- data.frame()

for(i in c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo")){
model <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data= penguins, species == i )
dfTemp <- data.frame(species= i, 
                      coefficient = coef(model)[2],
                      intercept = coef(model)[2])
coefout <- rbind(coefout,dfTemp)
}
coefout
```

It is also possible to nest `for` loops within one another. Nested for loops are more common and more efficient in other programming languages. However, they are still possible in R and have their utility. We can repeat the above example using another subset. 

```{r}
## Empty data.frame to fill
coefout <- data.frame()

for(i in c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo")){
  for(j in 2007:2009){
    
model <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data= penguins, species == i & year == j )
dfTemp <- data.frame(species= i, 
                     year = j,
                      coefficient = coef(model)[2],
                      intercept = coef(model)[2])
coefout <- rbind(coefout,dfTemp)
  }
}
coefout
```

Here the sky is the limit. Really, anything you can do once, can be set to run infinitely using for loops. The vectors supplied to `i` or `j` can be hundreds, thousands, or longer. You can have multiple nestings within one another. Our examples here use dataframes and vectors, but all this could be repeated with rasters, plots, graphics, or any object loaded into R. There are many, many options. This is where I believe the `for` loop has its greatest strength. Using this formula, anything that can be loaded into R can be replicated this way. 

There is a formula that I try and follow. The formula is as follows:

1. Create a object to receive exports from the loop.
2. Specify a vector to change (either a number to iterate through or specific elements)
3. Run the operation (remember most objects in this section will be constantly written over each iteration)
4. Export needed elements to external object


Let's try that formula with some plots
```{r}

par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for(i in 1:3){
  for(j in 1:3){
  tempdf <- rnorm(1000, mean= i, sd = j )
  hist(tempdf, main=paste0("Mean = ",i," & SD = ",j))
  }
}


```

Next, we are going to look at troubleshooting some problems in `for` loops.
